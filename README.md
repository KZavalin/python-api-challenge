# python-api-challenge

Dear graders,

Please find my code in the main folder as "VacationPy.ipynb" and "WeatherPy.ipynb". The "starter_code" directory contains the starter versions of these files that don't contain any of my edits. The output plots from WeatherPy can be found in the "output_data" directory. I did not upload my api_keys as these are private. If you wish to run the API search in my code, please provide your own API keys. A template file for these can be found in the "starter_code" directory and will need to be filled and placed in the main directory. 

Thank you!
-Kirill
